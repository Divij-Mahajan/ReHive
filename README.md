# ReHive - Decentralized Job Referral Network

ReHive is a hive-powered platform designed to streamline and democratize the job referral process. By leveraging decentralized technology, ReHive empowers job seekers and referrers alike, fostering a transparent, merit-based, and community-driven hiring ecosystem.

## Problem Statement
In the competitive job market, securing a position has become more about luck than talent. The current hiring landscape often leaves deserving candidates behind, leading to low confidence and missed opportunities. ReHive aims to address this by directly connecting job seekers with referrers, bypassing traditional recruitment agencies and reducing hiring costs.

## Solution Overview
ReHive is built on the Hive blockchain, enabling:
- **Transparent Referrals:** Job seekers can request referrals through a secure, decentralized system.

- **Efficient Process:** All referral transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring trust and eliminating middlemen.

### How It Works
1. **Job Seekers**:
   - Browse job listings and apply for referrals.
   - Pay a small fee in HIVE tokens for each referral request, covering transaction costs.

2. **Referrers**:
   - Review and refer qualified job seekers.
   - Earn HIVE tokens for successful referrals.

3. **Blockchain Integration**:
